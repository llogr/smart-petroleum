                <p><img src="img\laurie.png" width="101px;">PROFESSOR LAURIE BOSWELL<br/>SENIOR CONSULTANT<br/><br/>Professor Laurie Boswell is an expert in structural design and has over 30 years experience in both onshore and offshore projects. He was Head of the Department of Civil Engineering at City University from 1991 until 1998.</p>
                <p>Laurie's professional activities have been and are currently varied. However, they support the belief that academic members of an engineering department must have close links with industry. In 1985, he was appointed as the Director of the City University Ocean Engineering Research Centre. He has acted as a consultant to BP, Wimpey Corporation, Noble Denton, Global Maritime, the Steel Construction Institute and British Steel (now Corus). In the latter, work has been carried out to develop the three latest products for application in Civil Engineering Construction. Currently, Professor Boswell is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineering and a member of the Independent Advisory Board of The American Bureau of Shipping. He is a member of the Education and Research and Development Committees of the Society of Underwater Technology and sits on European Committees for Construction and Education.</p>
                <p>Laurie has published relevant material in internationally recognised journals such as, Geotechnique, Proc. of the Institution of Civil Engineering, International Journal of Solids and Structures and the International Journal of Constructional Steelwork. Alternatively and appropriately some material has been more effectively disseminated in special publications, such as Her Majesty's Stationary Office and special editions of the International Journal of Marine Structures.</p>
                <p>Laurie is the organiser of the international conference on “The Jack-up Platform- Design, Construction & Operation”  at City University. The first conference was held in 1985 and the successive biannual conferences have been a great success. The conferences have proved to be an excellent forum for the exchange of ideas and the discussion of recent developments in the offshore oil and gas industry particularly related to jack-up technology. They have also contributed to the development of code of practice.</p>
                <p>Professor Boswell has been responsible for writing a textbook and editing several others, including Platform Superstructures, Design and Construction and The Jack-up Drilling Platform. In all, he has published over 100 papers in journals, conferences and contributions to textbooks.</p>
